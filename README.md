A GraphQL API for the NotEnoughItem (NEI) crafting database!
This is designed to work with database exported from [D-Cysteine/nesql-exporter](https://github.com/D-Cysteine/nesql-exporter).

Written in Kotlin with [Ktor](https://ktor.io/), [ktorm](https://www.ktorm.org/), and [kGraphQL](https://kgraphql.io/).
